# ROBO-CON 2025 Robot 🤖🏆

>🏅 Winners of the **Best Design Award** at Texas Christian University’s Annual ROBO-CON 2025

## 🧠 Project Overview
Over the course of three months, we designed, built, and programmed a custom Arduino Uno robot completely from scratch to compete in the following ROBO-CON events:

- ⚽ **ROBO-Soccer** 
- 🧭 **Autonomous Maze Navigation** 
- 🏁 **Head-to-Head Obstacle Race** 

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- HM-10 Bluetooth Module
- Dabble App (Bluetooth control via smartphone)
- Ultrasonic Sensor + Servo Motor
- Blender (for 3D design)
- Bambu A1 3D Printer

---

## 🛠 My Contributions
As a computer science student, I focused on **Bluetooth remote control** and **autonomous maze navigation**.

---

### 🔵 Bluetooth Remote Control
- Used for ROBO-Soccer and the Obstacle Race.
- Programmed the Arduino to receive serial data from the **HM-10 Bluetooth module**.
- Used the **Dabble Gamepad** module to control the robot’s movement from a smartphone. 
- Tuned motor responsiveness with PWM for improved turning and speed control.

**🎓 What I Learned**
- Hardware-software integration.
- Troubleshoot bluetooth serial communication.
- Optimize system responsiveness.

---

### 🤖 Autonomous Maze Navigation
- Developed a **wall-following algorithm** for autonomous pathfinding  
- Mounted an **ultrasonic sensor on a servo** to enable wide-angle scanning
- Programmed the servo to rotate for dynamic wall detection

**🎓 What I Learned**
- Translate theoretical algorithms into real-world performance.
- Importance of sensor calibration to handle sensor noise and unexpected edge cases.

---

## 🧱 Mechanical Design
- **Tank-style** design
-  Modeled in **Blender**
-  Printed using a **Bambu A1 3D printer**
- Focused on creating a sturdy, balanced structure and custom attachments that met all competition rules.
